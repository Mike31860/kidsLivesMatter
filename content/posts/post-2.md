Here's an overview of what Kids Lives Matter does in relation to peace and justice:

Peace Education: Kids Lives Matter incorporates peace education into its curriculum, providing participants with knowledge and understanding of peacebuilding principles, conflict resolution strategies, and nonviolent communication techniques. Through workshops and interactive sessions, young people learn about the importance of peace, tolerance, and respect for diversity.

Participants are involved in community service projects that promote reconciliation, social cohesion, and equal access to resources. They work collaboratively with community members, local organizations, and stakeholders to address conflicts and create peaceful environments.
